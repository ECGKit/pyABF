title: pyABF - A Simple Python Library for Working with ABF Files
description: pyABF is a Python package for reading electrophysiology data from Axon Binary Format (ABF) files
---

**pyABF is a Python package for reading electrophysiology data from Axon Binary Format (ABF) files.** In contrast to the official interface (a 32-bit Windows-only DLL), pyABF is written in pure Python and runs on all operating systems (including 64-bit environments). PyABF's API aims to be intuitive enough that when used with a predictive IDE, documentation is largely unnecessary.

## Installation

[pyABF is available on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pyabf/) and can be installed with pip:

```
pip install --upgrade pyabf
```

## Quickstart

```python
import pyabf
abf = pyabf.ABF("demo.abf")
abf.setSweep(sweepNumber: 3, channel: 0)
print(abf.sweepY) # displays sweep data (ADC)
print(abf.sweepX) # displays sweep times (seconds)
print(abf.sweepC) # displays command waveform (DAC)
```

## Plot Sweeps with Matplotlib
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pyabf
abf = pyabf.ABF("demo.abf")
abf.setSweep(14)
plt.plot(abf.sweepX, abf.sweepY)
plt.show()
```

## Documentation
* The [**pyABF tutorial**](tutorial) demonstrates how to use the common features of pyABF

## Features
* No obscure dependencies (just matplotlib and numpy)
* Battle-tested and actively maintained (2017 - present)
* Pythonic API (methods and data are easy to locate with a predictive IDE)
* Pure python package with full cross-platform support (32-bit and 64-bit)
* Can read ABF1 and ABF2 files (including ABF 2.9 files created by pCLAMP 11)
* Can convert ABF2 to ABF1 format to allow analysis with legacy software
* Epoch table stimulus waveforms can be generated
* Automatically integrates with external ABF and ATF stimulus files
* Digital output waveforms can be accessed
