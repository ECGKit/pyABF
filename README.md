**pyABF is a Python module which simplifies the process of reading electrophysiology data from Axon Binary Format (ABF) files.** It was created with the goal of providing a Pythonic API to access the content of ABF files which is so intuitive to use (with a predictive IDE) that documentation is largely unnecessary. Flip through the [quickstart guide](https://github.com/swharden/pyABF/tree/master/docs/getting-started) and you'll be analyzing and graphing ABFs in minutes!

### Installation
```bash
pip install --upgrade pyabf
```

### Quickstart
```python
import pyabf
abf = pyabf.ABF("demo.abf")
abf.setSweep(3)
print(abf.sweepY) # displays sweep data (ADC)
print(abf.sweepX) # displays sweep times (seconds)
print(abf.sweepC) # displays command waveform (DAC)
```

## Features
* To see what pyABF can do, review the [simple](/docs/getting-started) and [advanced](/docs/getting-started/advanced.md) examples
* No obscure dependencies (just matplotlib and numpy)
* Actively developed (as of 2019)
* Pythonic API (methods and data are easy to locate with a predictive IDE)
* Cross-platform, open-source, 100% Python
* Supports 32-bit and 64-bit architectures
* Supports Python 3.6+ (pyabf 2.1.10 supports Python 2.7 and 3.5)
* Can read ABF1 and ABF2 files (including ABF 2.9 files created by pCLAMP 11)
* Can write ABF files (including conversion from ABF2 to ABF1 format compatible with [MiniAnalysis](http://www.synaptosoft.com/MiniAnalysis/))
* Stimulus waveform generation from epoch information
* Access to digital output settings and waveforms
* Can load waveforms from external ABF and ATF stimulus files (with caching)

## Citing pyABF
If the pyABF module facilitated your research, consider citing this project by name so it can benefit others too:

> _"Analysis of electrophysiological recordings was performed with custom software written for this project using Python 3.7 and the pyABF module."_

## Feature Requests / Unsupported ABF Files
If you have ABF files which are unsupported (or read incorrectly) by this software, it is likely due to a use case we have not run across yet, so let us know about it! We can only develop and test this software against ABF files we have access to, so if you're interested in having your ABF file supported send the primary author an email (and the ABF file you are trying to analyze) and we will investigate it. If a solution is reached the pyabf package will be updated so everyone can benefit from the change. We can only develop for (and test against) ABFs we have access to, so we really appreciate your contributions!
